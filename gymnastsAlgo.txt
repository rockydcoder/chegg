Step 1: Get the name and score of each gymnast and write it as a list.
Step 2: Write the name of the first gymnast and his/her score on a separate sheet, assuming it to be highest.
Step 3: Go through the list one by one, if you find a score higher than the current maximum score, just replace the score and name of the gymnast.
Step 4: As you reach the end of the list, you will have the maximum score and the gymnast who earned it on the other sheet.
