/*readBike:-
*Purpose: reads bikes from the file, creates new Bike object, and calls functions to add bike to the
*general list, to the list sorted by id, and to the list sorted by the manufacturer.
*Parameters - handle to the input file, and head pointers to the three lists.
*/

*addBike:-
*Purpose: adds bike to the general list
*Parameters: pointer to the first node in the list, pointer to the new node
*Returns pointed to the first node in the list.
*This function is overloaded with two other functions below
*/

*addBike:- (optional)
*Purpose: Overloaded function to add bike to the list, sorted by ID.
*Note, that you have only one set of nodes. You will need to implement different
*lists by different sets of pointers.
* + 5 extra points.
*/

*addBike:- (optional)
*Purpose: Overloaded function to add bike to the list, sorted by the manufacturer.
*Note that the last parameter is just a placeholder to tell compiler to call this
*overloaded function. you can pass any value there, it is not used in the function.
*+ 5 extra points
*/
Bike * addBike(Bike * head_manufacturer, Bike * new_bike, order, int);
/*
*printBike:-
*Purpose: Prints any list of bikes, that have not been deleted, depending on the
*status, and the head pointer passed. If status is RENTED, you print only bikes
*that are rented. If status is ALL, you print the entire list of (not deleted)
*bikes. Note, that depending on the list, you pointer assignments should be
*different.
*The last part is not applicable if you choose not to implement sorted list
*Parameters:
*Bike* - pointer to the first node of the list of bikes.
*order - needed to control pointer re-assignment. I.e. if order == ID,
* you should move along the list, sorted by ID.
*status - Determines which bikes to print from the list. I.e. rented, not
* rented, or all.
*/

/*do_transact:-
*Purpose: Reads the ID, number of days from the file, and depending on the status
*(RENTED/NOT_RENTED) either rents bike to the person (in which case you need to
* read person's name from the file, or performs return transaction. If transaction
*is rented, you should also display the total cost of the rent
*(number of days * cost of rent per day).
*in both cases, if status of bike does not correspond to the type of the
* transaction (i.e. you try to rent the bike which status is RENTED), you need to
* output an appropriate message and return.

*del_id_bike:-
*Purpose: Finds the bike by the ID in the list and sets its deleted flag to true.
*Note, that you do not delete the node. You set its deleted flag to true.
*Parameters:
*fstream object to the file to read the bike's ID
*pointer to the head of the bike's list sorted by ID. If you did not implement
*the sorted list, pass there a pointer to the head of the general list.

*Purpose: Finds the bike by the manufacturer's name in the list and sets its

/*
deleteBikes:-
*Purpose: To traverse the general list of bikes and deletes all the nodes in
*it, releasing back the memory. It is called before your program exits.
*Note, that if you implemented any dynamically allocated memory in the node,
*you will need to release that memory first, before deleting the node itself.
*Parameters:
*pointer to the head of the general list of bikes.

*Purpose: This function initializes the new Bike's object to all default values
